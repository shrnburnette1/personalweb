			<h1>These are the "Seven Habits of Highly Effective People"</h1>
				<cite>From a book by Stephen Covey</cite>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Br Proactive</strong></li>  <!--ordered list-->
					<q>Taking initiative does not mean being pushy, obnoxious,
					or aggressive. It does mean recognizing our responsibility 
					to make things happen.</q>
				<li><strong>Begin With the End in Mind</strong></li>
					<q>(This habit)...is based on imagination-- the ability to envision, 
					to see the potential, to create with our minds what we cannot at
					present see with our eyes...</q>
				<li><strong> Put First Things First</strong></li>
					<q>Create a clear, mutual understanding of what needs to be accomplished, 
					focusing on what, not how; results not methods. Spend time. Be patient. 
					Visualize the desired result.</q>
				<li><strong>Think Win-Win "Win-Win</strong></li>
					<q> A frame of mind that constantly seeks mutual benefit in all human interactions. 
					Win-Win means that agreements or solutions are mutually beneficial and satisfying.</q>
				<li><strong>Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood</strong></li>
						<q>'Seek First to Understand' involves a very deep shift in paradigm. We typically seek 
					first to be understood. Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they 
					listen with the intent to reply. They're either speaking or preparing to speak. 
					They're filtering everything through their own paradigms, reading their autobiography 
					into other people's lives.</q>
				<li><strong>Synergize</strong></li>
					<q>Synergy works; it's a correct principle. It is the crowning achievement of all the previous habits. 
					It is effectiveness in an interdependent reality-- it is teamwork, team building, the development 
					of unity and creativity with other human beings.</q>
				<li><strong>Sharpening the Saw</strong></li>
					<q>This is the habit of renewal...It circles and embodies all the other habits. It is the habit
					of continuous improvement...that lifts you to new levels of understanding and living each of the habits.</q>

			pow, a crisis can come your way. Whether it is work, differences amongst family and friends, bad relationships, 
			financial struggles, or just a bad day, sometimes it can be overwhelming and hard to deal with.

						<i>Winston Churchill</i>
					<li><strong>Use Pain As Fuel</strong></li>

						<i>August Wilson</i>
					<li><strong>Keep Yourself Together</strong></li>
						<q>Anyone can give up, it's the easiest thing in the world to do. But to hold it together when
						everyone else would understand if you fell apart, that's true strength.</q><br>
